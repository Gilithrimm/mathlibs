Introduction
--------
[//]: # (What this project is and what it isn't)
This little project is my shared code grouped together.
It's not meant to be one singular solution to one 
problem - rather it's meant to be like different simple solutions grouped together

Features
--------
[//]: # (What it can and can't do)
This project is split into **modules** - independent, consistent miniprojects.
Currently, these modules are available:
 - com.safenar.math: Sequences and operations on them.
 - com.safenar.timer: Extension to java.util.Timer, allowing to pause the timer and resume it.
 - more to come in the future!

How to use
--------
1. todo adding jar to maven
2. If you're done and set up correctly, 
you can check out the docs. 
They're in the `docs` folder.
(yes I know I should've hosted them and add the link it's just too much effort rn)
3. Experiment with the projects and what they hae to offer!

[//]: # (Installation, some 'getting started',
    in this case just add maven and/or gradle)

Contributing
--------
todo how does GitHub work and handle things like this  
If you need to generate the javadoc for the project, run 
`./javadoc.sh`

[//]: # (How can one add their code

Support me
